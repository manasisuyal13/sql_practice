Day 1: Basics & Sorting
Queries: SELECT, FROM, WHERE.

Operators: Filtering with = and !=.

Sorting: ORDER BY using ASC (default) and DESC (highest first).

Logic: Sorting by multiple columns (e.g., Country then Score).

Day 2: Aggregations & Logic
Aggregates: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT().

Grouping: GROUP BY to summarize data by category (e.g., total score per country).

Filtering Groups: Using HAVING (filters after grouping) vs WHERE (filters before).

Refining: DISTINCT for unique lists and TOP for limiting results.

Execution Order: Understanding that SQL processes FROM first and SELECT/TOP last.
